<h2><CENTER>Sample behavioral waveforms for design file fifo80.vhd </CENTER></h2>
<P>The following waveforms show the behavior of dcfifo megafunction for the chosen set of parameters in design fifo80.vhd.  The design fifo80.vhd has a depth of 256 words of 80 bits each. The fifo is in show-ahead synchronous mode.  The data becomes available before 'rdreq' is asserted; 'rdreq' acts as a read acknowledge. </P>
